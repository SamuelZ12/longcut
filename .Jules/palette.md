## 2024-05-23 - Clear Actions in Inputs
**Learning:** Users often paste incorrect URLs and need a quick way to reset the input field. A dedicated "Clear" button (X) is a standard pattern that improves speed and reduces friction compared to selecting all text and deleting.
**Action:** When implementing input fields that are the primary action of a page (like a search bar or URL input), always consider adding a "Clear" button that appears when content is present. Ensure it is accessible (focusable, labelled) and returns focus to the input after clicking.
